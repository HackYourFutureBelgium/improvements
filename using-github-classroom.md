An option for us is to use [github classroom](https://github.com/education/classroom)/[github education](https://education.github.com/) to manage Hack Your Future, but is not a complete solution.

> "GitHub Classroom automates repository creation and access control, making it easy for teachers to distribute starter code and collect assignments on GitHub."

This is a very helpful tool for assigning, tracking and validating individual or group assignments. You can create assignment repositories with starter code, assign them to groups of students, and check their work from the teacher interface.

Two main reasons why classrooms is not a complete solution for HYF:
1. github classroom is not intended to manage classroom content, lesson plans, or organize an entire curriculum.  It is a tool focused on distributing, collecting and assessing assignments hosted in repositories.  I think a lot of this can be duplicated with CI & labled/well-named commits/issues and a dashboard built with the GitHub API.
2. It is very important that everything we do to run HackYourFuture is replicable by anyone with a github account and a little programming experience. We need to be sure that any way we use GitHub Classrooms doesn't get in the way of others starting another HYF.
