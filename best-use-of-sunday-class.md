what's the best use of in-person class time?

To balance:
* expecting them to show up with basics ready so you can do more complex things together _vs._ covering the basics in class so they're ready to work at home.
* challenging and engaging advanced students _vs._ supporting and teaching less experienced. (stronger entrance criteria and classes separated by level will help with this)
* teaching good habits and practices from the beginning _vs._ letting students find their way how it works best for them
* reviewing the last week's work _vs._ introducing the new week's material
* covering subject matter (js, DOM, ...) _vs._ covering methodology and workflows (submission processes, project formats, ...)
* base theory and skills _vs._ practical & productivity skills


Possibilities
* many "easy" practice problems over the week, then do harder ones together in class to see the skills come together
* first half of class is dedicated to review and connecting last week's material, the second half is to start the next week's project together
