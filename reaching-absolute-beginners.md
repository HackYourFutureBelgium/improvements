How do we best address absolute beginners with the first module of JS?

> there should be another module in the beginning about running js without DOM or full websites, focus on syntax & stepping through with debuggers: [new module in curriculum repo (branch 9-10](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/curriculum/blob/9-10/02-testing-and-debugging.md)

right now the class isn't working well for the student who need it most.  students who have experience or learn programming quickly will learn as long as we do a good enough job.  students with no experience or who struggle to get traction at the beginning will suffer if we don't get the first steps just right.  So we should tailor everything towards them and can always throw challenges at the more advanced students.

common sticking-points for brand new students:
* working with documents and folders, opening files in editors, saving them and finding them again
* source code. is it the program? is it instructions? what's it's relationship to the things that log?
* where to run code and see the results. what are the results anyway and how can they be logged?
* programs execute step by step over time, not automatically all at once. these steps can be seen and understood
* what are errors? how to begin understanding what they mean, where to find them and how to fix them?
* variables: they're not like equality in mathematics. declaration vs. assignment. their values can change over time.
* functions: arguments? return values? in what order are lines executed?
* values and their types. how are these different from variables?
* ... ?


alternative philosophies for the first encounter (can be mixed and matched)
* start with visual and motivating projects, fill in the theory and best practices later
  * _a project would be like_: make little websites with some interactivity tagged behind it, if it works it's probably good enough. it's more important that it does something a student wants to do so they keep studying
* start with the big theoretical picture and make it concrete one piece at a time
  * _a project would be like_: part theory part coding. working from abstracted diagrams/flow-charts towards projects that implement them
* introduce best habits from the beginning in the simplest way possible, students can grow into them over time
  * _a project would be like_: learn to organize & plan projects in parallel to learning the language.  often doing the "right thing" before understanding entirely why
* focus first on isolated programming skills, then build them up into full development
  * _a project would be like_: lots of javascript and coding challenges in isolation, a full module of things like FCC & simple files in Node.js. these skills can them be translated into more complex projects and environments
