how should these process work?
* for students
* for coaches
* for coordinators

based on these constraints:
* to the student it should be as close as possible to open-source contribution
* to the coaches it should be easy to do bit by bit, and shouldn't require learning a lot of new workflow
* to coordinators, it should be possible to easily and in one place see how one class is progressing with their module, or how a single student has progressed across modules


The best solution might be a pre-defined github workflow and a dashboard app built off the github api for visualizing the activity simply and in one place
* there would need to be standardized PR labeling
* coaches could use issues on a student's fork to provide specific feedback
* this workflow could grow with each module (at least from the student's side) until they have already learned to develop on a shared repository using branches to separate units of work
