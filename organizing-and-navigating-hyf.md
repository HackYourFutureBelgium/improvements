There's a lot of repos and a lot of resources, there is probably no way around this so the only thing left to do is organize it all very well

---

a more effective way of organizing content & assignments in module repositories. 
* check out [Working with Code](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/working-with-code) to see the new module repo organization

Standardized week roles? would it work to have a standardized goal for each week across all modules. something like:
1. what is this new thing and why is it helpful? - spend time in class doing little exercises to get the feel for the first week's homework and the new tools/techniques
2. the moduleâ€™s project structure & collaboration practice.  start to put the thing you saw last week into context
3. a final module project that confronts the pains next module will adress


nice details
* include estimated completion time or difficulty for each assignment so students can plan
