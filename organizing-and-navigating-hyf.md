There's a lot of repos and a lot of resources, there is probably no way around this so the only thing left to do is organize it all very well!

---

a more effective way of organizing content & assignments in module repositories.  here's an idea to take as a starting point:
* how the new repos are organized for [html/css/github](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/html-css-github/wiki/Navigating-this-repo) and [js 1](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1/wiki/Navigating-this-repo)

Standardized week roles? would it work to have a standardized goal for each week across all modules. something like:
1. what is this new thing and why is it helpful? - spend time in class doing little exercises to get the feel for the first week's homework and the new tools/techniques
2. the moduleâ€™s project structure & collaboration practice.  start to put the thing you saw last week into context
3. a final module project that confronts the pains next module will adress


nice details
* include estimated completion time or difficulty for each assignment so students can plan
