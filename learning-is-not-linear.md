> update: modules with names and objectives that describe general competencies & project complexity instead of particular technologies - [curriculum gitbook](https://curriculum.hackyourfuture.be)

Hello Evan, I went over that circular learning thing and tried to word it to better communicate it. Not as easy as I hoped :stuck_out_tongue:
Basically to communicate it, I find the main points of the idea are as follow:
What problems does it try to solve?

Learning to program is often expressed as a linear progression, mastering one thing at a time and moving on towards the one-day-complete skills of a fullstack developer.   This is apparent in popular sites like [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) and even the [HYF curriculum](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/curriculum).

This conception of learning web dev is not accurate, and (possibly) actively unhelpful:
* Skills are taught and studied in isolation when it's really their integration that is most difficult and important to learn
* Anxiety of the endless road caused by linear teaching (cf. roadmap.sh), eventually reaching a useful skill set
* No intuition towards what is the problem that some technologies address/solve (since the full and integrated context where they are used is not covered until later)

An 'agile' conception of the learning journey (and therefore the module names and objectives) would be much more helpful and encouraging:
* Each module should be designed around a comprehensive skill set needed for a well-defined deliverable (ie. in module 1 you will learn to build and deploy static site to github pages, to start your site from a fork, and to split your progress into clear and incremental stages)
* Fostering accomplishments (therefore confidence) by focusing on bringing the minimum amount of skills for a certain goal
* Preempt the module technologies/learning objectives by building projects in the previous module that confront the challenges solved by the next module's technologies/learning objectives

### how could this be visualized/communicated?

__communicated__

Roadmap.sh and traditional way of teaching:
> You will (eventually, one day, most likely) be this rocket :rocket: !

Agile learning (or whatever):
> You will be this  :scooter: (next week!) , then you will be this :bike:  (in a month!), then you will be this :motor_scooter: (in two months!) , â€¦


__visualized__

is there a clear visualization of what this looks like that could be used for students to see where they're headed and how far they are?
* a possibility would be a diagram of fullstack web apps that is introduced at the beginning, and each module highlights one part of the diagram.  students can see their understanding of the whole diagram filling out over time
