how can coaching be as accessible as possible?

---

Possible different coaching roles:
* __Sunday coaches__ (exists already): what you know already. sunday coaches come in on 3 sunday afternoons to run class and answer questions
* __Review coaches__ (new): come in sunday mornings to help at pre-class study sessions for students in any module (students have been coming in early to study).  you can come in as often or not as you like, one sunday at a time, there is no strict commitment
* __Homework checkers__: (Amsterdam has this role):  help review and check off homework over the week with no in-person commitment.  This would be done as a code-review process over github.
* __Class companions__: a role connected to a class of students instead of a module.  you agree to follow along with your class from the beginning to the end so they can have some continuity.  there might be no strict in-person commitment with most of the role being a presence on slack.

Support HYF can provide for coaches:
* more and better onboarding resources (including resources on github and how we use it)
* easy to use, quality, module materials easy to use in one place. including slides, lesson plans and code-alongs
* better handoff to module coaches so you can know about the students, their levels, and what they've seen so far
* video guides for home-work check-off and review
