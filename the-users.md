who are the different users of this curriculum and what are their interests/concerns/needs?

please add to or modify this list!

---

__students__
* They come in with a wide variety of backgrounds and levels of experience with informatics, and want to leave in 6 months ready for an internship or junior level position.
* Though there are coaches, from the students' point of view this course is largely an independent/peer study course.  They see the coaches for only 4 hours a week plus some slack support, and rarely have the same coaches for more than 3 weeks.
* All course materials should easily findable and amenable to review several months later, and completed homeworks should double as review materials


__coaches__
* Want to help the students by sharing their experience with sunday lectures, homework code reviews, and answering questions on slack.
* Are generally fitting in coaching next to a full-time job and other personal commitments.
* Do not always have experience teaching and preparing course materials, or have the time to prepare course materials if they do have the experience.
* Should be able to easily contribute to the curriculum to keep it relevant and improving, matching as much as possible standard open-source contribution patterns


__hyf coordinators__
* Are not always experienced programmers or educators (at least when they start out).
* Need to individually support and track the progress of at least 30 students at once.
* Be able to easily onboard new students and coaches.
* Maintain a large open source curriculum as efficiently as possible

__new hyf spin-offs__
* These can be anything from a few friends setting up a study group to an exiting institution wishing to launch their own branch of HYF
* They need to be able to use our lesson plans, study/submission workflows, tracking processes, ... as readily as possible with as little technical setup as possible
* Need to be able to adapt and remix the contents to fit their contexts (ie. student backgrounds, length of course, weekly class time, local job market, ...)
